							<h2>I am leaving academia.</h2>
							<p>
								In June 2017 I will bow out of research and start a new life in a private company, which I am very much looking forward to. This is why I shortly want to lay out my reasons for giving up my previous life and start anew.<br><br>

								Certainly, you all know that the conditions of employment at universities are continuously getting worse. I finished my Ph.D. when I was 26 years old. I was excited and motivated, looking forward to pursuing a career in science. After I even won a prize for my work and got a job in a renowned institute for evolutionary biology in one of the world's most beautiful cities, I knew that this was my way to go.<br><br>

								Meanwhile, things have changed. After five years as a postdoc with regular moving and starting over I simply cannot continue. Except for getting a professorship (for which I am too young), there is no alternative way of getting a permanent contract in Germany. I love my job. But even more so do I want to build up a happy and stable life with my wife. This is why I say good-bye to this system.<br><br>

								After almost a decade of research, I do, however, look back at this time full of gratitude. I met great people, visited amazing places and worked on fascinating projects. Of course, I hope that my publications may inspire future work.<br><br>

								Finally, there is only one thing left to say: Thank you so much to everyone I met during this time. Thank you for our common experiences and fruitful joint work. I hope, we'll meet again!<br><br>
								
								Wishing you all the very best,<br>
								Alex Kubisch

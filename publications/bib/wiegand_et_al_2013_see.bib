	abstract = {Guided tours are the method of choice for school classes visiting botanical gardens. However, it remains unclear, which influence such teacher-centered approaches have on learning outcome in such informal learning environments. We compare a teacher- to a student-centered learning at workstations program under the topic plants and water. 16 school classes at eighth grade visited the botanical garden of the University of Würzburg, attending either one of both treatments. We used multiple-choice questionnaires measuring knowledge scores and found no significant differences in learning outcome – tested in a pre-post-retention design. We also monitored the students’ intrinsic motivation, which resulted in similar and high scores. Possible causes for our results and consequences for education at botanical gardens are discussed.},
